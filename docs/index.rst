Welcome to BQSKit's documentation!
==================================

BQSKit is a superoptimizing quantum compiler that aims to provide an
easy-to-use and quick-to-extend software package around quantum synthesis.
This is accomplished by first building a quantum circuit intermediate
representation designed to work efficiently with numerical optimizer
based synthesis algorithms, and second bundling a compiler infrastructure
and algorithm framework that can run many algorithms efficiently.
